# Character and String Implementation in OCaml

My Project Proposal was to implement Characters and Strings along with some basic functions for Strings.

Implemented Characters and Strings using OCaml character and strings.
Implemented the most common String functions that are used in other languages.
The list of functions that implemented are the following:
-String concatenation
-String length
-String compare
-String copy
-String at (The same function as [] operator)
-String upper
-String lower
